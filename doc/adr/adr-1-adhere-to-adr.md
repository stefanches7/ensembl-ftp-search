ADR-1: Adhere to ADR
====================
Context
-------
Decisions made through the initial period and later on should be tracked. ADR format is much better than collecting a heap of Trello cards.

Decision
--------
Further on, I am writing Markdown files on each architectural decision I take and put those in the current directory.
Please note that decisions can be reverted - the corresponding -REVERT mark will be in the name of a file with the revert decision.
