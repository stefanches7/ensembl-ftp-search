ADR 7: Way of documenting
=========================

Context
-------
Things sometimes need to be documented. The more comfortable to read it later the better.
Markdowns sync with GitHub very well, javadoc can be either easily browsed.

Decision
--------
Write .md files in directories and Javadoc when needed.
