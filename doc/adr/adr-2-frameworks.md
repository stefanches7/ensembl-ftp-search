ADR 2: Pick project-wide frameworks
===================================
Context
-------
I will need to connect/implement RESTful interfaces; have to do with the database records; implement Javascript user-interface,
test code and so on. Thank frameworks I can cut on time implementing that.

Decision
--------
Pick Spring Data as an ORM Framework, Spring Boot & Jersey for REST integrity. The Java project overlay will be Gradle, testing with Travis CI,
ReactJS for the UI components.
