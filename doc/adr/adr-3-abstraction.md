ADR 3: Abstract architecture
============================
Context
-------
Things around can change rapidly and drastically. 

Decision
--------
I will try to declare the skeleton of the Project as abstract as possible (for instance, with the help of Spring Boot & Jersey) for the sake
of more comfortable implementation's change later.
