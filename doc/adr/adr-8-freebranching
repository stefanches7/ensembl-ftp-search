ADR 7: Rule-free git commit & branch
====================================
Context
-------
The current project is relatively small and is going to have (mainly) one contributor. Some git best practices that make sense in big, crowded
projects will be more of impediment in the current project.
Decision
--------
Do not care much about git and history. Please note that git history can therefore get really messy; well I hope to document the project
good enough so that nobody will have to ever look at the commits flow :)
